                    <p> The web is made up of all of the computers and their communication with each other.
                      The major components are the user, the user's computer running a web
                      browser, the Internet, and servers. When a person goes to a website like <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/">
                      DeviantArt </a> the browser makes a request via the <em>Internet</em> to <em>Servers</em>.
                      These requests are made using the protocal <em>HTTP</em>. The servers respond by
                      locating and sending back the requested HTML document(s) to the user's
                      computer where the web browser interprets the html document and displays it
                      on the user's screen.  See
                      <a href="https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd000/parts/0001345401/modules/385165862675460/lessons/3873828673/concepts/483298540923">

                <h4 class = "sublessontitle">HTML</h4>
                <div class = "sublesson">
                  <p> HTML stands for <b><em>Hypertext Markup Language.</em></b> HTML documents form the majority of the
                  content on the web. HTML documents contain <em>text content</em> which describes "what you see"
                  and <em>markup</em> which describes "how it looks".
                  <p>

                  <p> HTML markup is made out of HTML elements. Generally, HTML elements consist of an opening tag, content,
                    and the closing tag. Void tags are tags that do not have a closing tag. These tags have no content and
                    hence do not need a closing tag. Tags also contain attributes. Tag attributes allow the user to
                    provide additional information about the element; tag attributes modify the default functionality of the
                    subject tag.
                  </p>

                  <p> One other important facet of HTML elements is that they are classified as either <em>inline</em> or
                  <em>block</em> elements. A block element starts on a new line and takes up the full width available.
                  Think of the block element as having a customizable invisble box around its content. Inline elements,
                  as the name suggests, take up only as much width as needed and do not start a new line for
                  content.
                  </p>
                </div>

                  <p>Computers are literal. They do not make inferences or assumptions. Computer programming languages
                    purposely limit ambiguity, but this sometimes conflicts with how the programmer interacts with
                    the computer. This is why procedural thinking is necessary when writing code. Small mistakes that
                    can easily be corrected by a human, are unforgivable to a computer and can cause huge problems
                    in a program.

                  <p>To understand the HTML document, first think of the stucture of a webpage. Think of a webpage as a house. The HTML document provides the structure of the house, CSS provides stylistic design features, and Javascript is the interactive elements of the house.</p>

                  <p>HTML is the language of the web. Tags and their attributes are the words of HTML. HTML facilitates the browser in classifying different elements of the webpage; text, image, video, etc. Element position, font size, and other stylistic elements are addressed using CSS.The HTML document itself, is a tree-like structure of elements. The browser turns HTML tags into elements that form the tree-like structure of the webpage.  </p>

                  <p>When approaching a new webpage design, it is important to remember that everything on the web is boxes. Boxify whatever design you recieve to make code writing easier and more succient. When reading an HTML document as text, indentations are indications of elements being nested into its corresponding box.

                  <p>Special text editors like Sublime Text and Atom are important tools for programmers. They make programming life a bit easier. For example, Sublime Text will automatically generate the closing HTML tag when the programmer writes the opening tag.</p>

                    <p> Harkening back to earlier in the lesson, boxes are everything on the Internet. To fully take control of your web design, an understanding of box on the web is crucial.

                      <br><br>
                      Content is the purely the image or text that appears on the website. It sits at the very center of box. The next layer of the box is the padding. It clears the area around the content and is effected by the background color of the  box. The next layer is the border of the box. It goes around the content and padding of the box. It is inherited from the color property of the box. The margin is the next layer. The margin is transparent. It is the space inbetween boxes. <strong>Remember that the size of the element is the sum of the border, paddings, and content. </strong>
                    </p>

                    </div>
                
                    <p>Use the box-sizing:border-box property to make calculations of the element size include both border and padding together. This is useful because then the user can tweak the border and padding separately but keep the overall element size the same.
                    </p>

                    <p>Remember that sizing can be done in either percentage or pixels.</p>

                  <div class="sublesson">
                    <p>The Flexbox Layout module aims at providing a more efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown and/or dynamic. <br><br>

                    The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container the ability to alter its items' width/height (and order) to best fill the available space (mostly to accommodate to all kind of display devices and screen sizes). A flex container expands items to fill available free space, or shrinks them to prevent overflow.
